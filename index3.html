                Naruto[a] is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto.<br>
                 It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers<br>
                and dreams of becoming the Hokage,the leader of his village. The story is told in two <br>
                partsâ€”the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens.

                earned Kishimoto an honorable mention in Shueisha's monthly Hop Step Award the following year, and Naruto (1997).
